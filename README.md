## CDA5106 – Dynamic Instruction Scheduling
---
### How to use the simulator
#### Vars

- S = The Scheduling Queue is S instructions in size
- N = Instructions per cycle
- TraceFile = Input trace file i.e val_trace_gcc.txt

---
#### Scripts


```
gcc main.c 
or 
./sim <S> <N> <TraceFile>
```

then 

- S = 2 – as an example of valid prop
- N = 8 – as an example of valid prop
- TraceFile = traces/val_trace_gcc.txt – as an example of valid prop

```
./a.out <S> <N> <TraceFile>
```
